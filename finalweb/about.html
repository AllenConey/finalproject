    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Allen Duane Coney, a junior at Louisiana State University studying Photography and Graphic Design. I'm from New Orleans, and Iâ€™m passionate about capturing moments and creating meaningful designs that resonate with people.</p>
    <p>Alongside my studies, I run my own media outlet, <strong>ADC Media</strong>, where I work on various photography and design projects. I also manage events as a Project Manager during the Bayou Classic week, where I collaborate on large-scale projects that bring the community together.</p>
    <p>My work is driven by my desire to showcase creativity, culture, and the beauty of life through visuals. I aim to inspire and connect with others through my art.</p>
